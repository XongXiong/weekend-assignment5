# Weekend Challenge 5 - Angular, Mongo, Mongoose Oh My!

## Technologies Used
- Mongo
- Express
- Angular
- Node

## Project Requirements

- [x] Create a Full Stack application from the ground up using Angular, Node, Express, and MongoDB
- [x] Work with the data set that we have provide for you
- [x] Use Bootstrap to present the data
- [x] Account for the different data properties ("rent" versus "cost") and ensure that this is noted on the display of the information, by listing "For Rent" or "For Sale" based on which of the two properties that it has.
- [x] 2 routes, each with a controller and template file. One set for "For Rent" properties and another set for "For Sale" properties
- [x] Create an interface for adding additional rental or housing properties to the collection(s). You will need to give the user an option for either a Rent property, or a Sale property

## Hard Mode

- [x] Ability to delete an existing listings
- [x] Move all HTTP/Ajax requests to Angular Service(s)

## Pro Mode

- [ ] Ability to update an existing record using a pop up (modal). You will need to research libraries that support modals (e.g. [Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/) or [ui-bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/))
- [x] Display the least expensive property featured at the top of the page.
- [ ] Ability to search or filter by various parameters (try doing this in Mongo instead of Angular)
